# Amazon Vine Analysis

## **Amazon Vine Analysis Overview:** 
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. In this part of the project, I've chosen to analyze the luggage dataset reviews and used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. I used PySpark to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.  The following summary of the analysis will be provided to Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.
